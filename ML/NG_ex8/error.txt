There is an error in ex8_cofi.m. For those interested in getting realistic movie ratings, please make the following correction:

In ex8_cofi.m, in the section "Part 7 : Learning Movie Ratings", around line 200, the value of theta is set by calling fmincg() using cofiCostFunction(). That call to cofiCostFunction() should use Ynorm, not Y.

Without making this correction, the movie ratings that are predicted can have a rating greater than "5 stars", which makes no sense if we're using a 5-point scale. 

This error was present in the course materials used to create Figure 4 in ex8.pdf.
